This project is spearheaded by Sophia Shapira -
who did the PHP scripting, provided some translation,
and arranged the missal from contributions by all
contributing authors, as well as <a href = "#credits_public">certain Public Domain
sources that were used</a>.
</p>


<p>
Thanks to Brother Andrew Blair for translating the
Creed for this project.
