<h2>Communion Rite</h2>

<p>Let us pray in the words that Our Lord taught us.</p>

<p><u>Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.</u></p>

<p><u>Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us,
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.</u></p>

<p><u>For <? $sm->cross(); ?>thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever.</u></p>

<p><u>Amen.</u>

<p>The peace of the Lord be always with you.</p>

<p><u>And with thy spirit.</u>

<p>Let us share amongst each other a sign of peace.</p>

<? $sm->insparg("All those present share a sign of peace with one another."); ?>

<? $sm->t("Lamb of God"); ?>

<? $sm->insparg("The <b>Lamb of God</b> prayer is said as the bread is broken into pieces, and a piece of it is added to the Chalice."); ?>

<p><u>O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, Have mercy upon us.</u></p>

<p><u>O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, Have mercy upon us.</u></p>

<p><u>O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, Grant us Thy peace.</u>
