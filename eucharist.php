<p>Blessed art Thou, My Lord, Our God, King of the Universe - who brings forth bread from the Earth.</p>

It may be the kind of wine thought of at default by the word \"wine\", which is fermented and still contains alcohol. But it may also be the kind of wine that has had the alcohol evaporated from it - or even the kind of wine that never was fermented to begin with (also known as \"grape juice\" - but we still call it \"wine\", because we maintain that it <i>is</i> wine, just the unfirmented kind). Bearing this in mind, do not assume that the wine used here is of any specific kind unless you have specifically been told that it is so."); ?>

<? $sm->insparg("The celebrant, if trained to do so, says the blessing over the cup in Hebrew before the vernacular."); ?>

<p>Blessed art Thou, My Lord, Our God, King of the Universe - who creates the Fruit of the Vine.</p>

<p><u>Amen.</u></p>

<p>
Accept us, O Lord, in the spirit of humility
and contrition of heart,
and grant that the sacrifice which we offer
this day in Thy sight may be pleasing to thee,
O Lord God.

<? $sm->gt("Eucharistic Prayer"); ?>

<p>The Lord be with you.</p>

<p><u>And with thy spirit.</u></p>

<p>Lift up your hearts.</p>
<!-- Sarum p. 300 -->

<p><u>We lift them up unto the Lord.</u></p>

<p>Let us give thanks unto our Lord, God.</p>

<p><u>It is meet and right so to do.</u></p>

<p>
It is very meet, right, just, and our bounden duty, that
we should at all times and in all places give thanks unto Thee,
O Lord Holy Father Almighty, everlasting God. Because
by the mystery of the Incarnate Word, the new light of Thy
Brightness shone upon the eyes of our mind, that, while weacknowledge Him to be God visibly, by Him we may be caught up unto the love of invisible things. And therefore with Angels and Archangels with thrones and dominions and with all the company of the Heavenly Host we magnify Thy glorious Name, evermore saying.
</p>
<!-- Sarum p. 301 -->

<p>
<u>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts -, heaven and earth are full of Thy glory. Hosanna in the highest. <? $sm->cross(); ?>Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord. Glory be to Thee, O Lord, in the highest.</u>
</p>
<!-- Sarum p. 308 -->

<p>Thee therefore, O most Merciful Father, through Jesus Christ Thy Son our Lord, we most humbly pray and entreat,
to accept and bless,
these <? $sm->mcross(); ?>gifts, these <? $sm->mcross(); ?>presents, this <? $sm->mcross(); ?>holy immaculate Sacrifice,
which we offer to Thee in the first place in behalf of Thy Holy Catholic Church, to which do Thou deign to give peace, to guard, to unite, and to govern it, throughout the whole world : together with Thy Servant our <?
$sm->instx("The patriarch we are under"); ?>, our Bishop <? $sm->instx("Name of our bishop"); ?> <?
$sm->instx("More names come here."); ?> all the Orthodox and maintainers of the Catholic and Apostolic Faith.
</p>
<!-- Sarum p. 309 -->

<p>
Remember, O Lord, Thy servants and handmaidens <? $sm->instx("More individuals are prayed for here"); ?> and all here present, whose faith is approved and whose devotion is known unto Thee ; in whose behalf we offer unto Thee, or who are engaged in offering unto Thee, this sacrifice of praise, for themselves and all pertaining to them, for the redemption of their souls, for the hope of their salvation and security ; and are paying their vows unto Thee, the eternal, living, and true God.
</p>
<!-- Sarum p. 309 -->

<p>
In communion with and reverencing the memory, in the first place, of the glorious and ever- Virgin Mary,
Mother of our God and Lord Jesus Christ; as also of Thy blessed Apostles and Martyrs, Peter and Paul, Andrew, James, John, Thomas, James, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Simon and Thaddaeus, Linus, Cletus, Clement, Sixtus, Cornelius, Cyprian, Laurence, Chrysogonus, John and Paul, Cosmas and Damian, and all Thy Saints ; for whose sake and prayers grant that in all things we may be strengthened by the aid of Thy protection. Through the same Christ our Lord.</p><p><u>Amen.</u>
</p>

</p>

<p>
Which oblation, we beseech Thee, O Almighty God,
that thou wouldest vouchsafe, in all respects,
to <? $sm->mcross(); ?>bless, <? $sm->mcross(); ?>approve,
<? $sm->mcross(); ?>ratify, and make reasonable
that it may become to us the <? $sm->mcross(); ?>Body
and the <? $sm->mcross(); ?>Blood
of Thy most dearly Beloved Son our Lord Jesus Christ -
</p>

<p>
Who on the day before He suffered took bread into His holy
and adorable hands, and lifting up his eyes to Heaven,
unto Thee, His Father, God Almighty,
gave thanks to Thee, blessed, brake, and gave it to His disciples, saying -
</p>



<? $sm->coreword("Take this all and eat. This is my body which
will be given up for you."); ?>

<? $sm->insparg("After placing the sacred Body of Christ on the patton, the celebrant kneels before the altar."); ?>

<p>
Likewise after Supper, taking also this most excellent chalice into His holy and adorable hands and giving thanks
to Thee, He blessed and gave it to His disciples, saying -
</p>


<? $sm->coreword("Take this all and drink - for here
is the chalice of my blood - the blood of the New and
Eternal Testament which will be poured out
for you and for many for the remission of sins.
Do this in my memory."); ?>

<? $sm->insparg("After placing the Chalice back on the altar, the celebrant

<p>And thus together we proclaim -</p>
<!-- This last snippet of a sentence I added as a prompter -->

 
<p><u>
For as often as we eat this bread, and drink the cup, we proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.
</u></p>
<!-- Taken from 1895 Revised Version 1 Cor 11:26 -
changed from second-person to first-person form. -->


<p>
Wherefore also, O Lord, we Thy servants together with Thy holy people, calling to mind the most blessed Passion of the same Christ Thy Son our Lord God, together with His Resurrection from the dead, and His glorious Ascension into Heaven, offer to Thy excellent Majesty of Thy gifts and bounties,
a <? $sm->mcross(); ?>pure, a <? $sm->mcross(); ?>holy, a <? $sm->mcross(); ?>spotless Sacrifice, the holy <? $sm->mcross(); ?>Bread of eternal life,
and the <? $sm->mcross(); ?>Cup of everlasting salvation.
</p>

<p>
Upon which do Thou vouchsafe to look with favorable and gracious countenance, and accept them as Thou didst accept the gifts of Thy righteous servant Abel, the sacrifice of our Patriarch Abraham, and the holy sacrifice, the pure oblation, which Thy High Priest Melchisedech offered to Thee,
</p>

<p>We humbly entreat Thee, Almighty God, command these things to be carried by the hands of Thy Holy Angel to Thy Altar on High before the sight of Thy Divine Majesty, that as many of us,
as shall by partaking at this Altar receive the
most sacred <? $sm->mcross(); ?>Body and <? $sm->mcross(); ?>Blood of Thy Son, may be fulfilled with all grace
and heavenly <? $sm->mcross(); ?>benediction,
through the same Christ our Lord
</p>

<p><u>Amen.</u></p>
<!-- Sarum - up to p. 312 -->

<? $sm->t("Prayer for the Dead"); ?>
<p>Remember also, O Lord, the souls of Thy servants and handmaidens, <? $sm->instx("Say their names"); ?> , who have gone before us with the sign of the faith, and sleep the sleep of peace ; to them, O Lord, and to all who rest in Christ, we pray Thee, grant a place of refreshment, of light, and of peace. Through the same Christ our Lord.</p><p><u>Amen.</u></p>

<? $sm->t(""); ?>

<p>
To us, also, Thy sinful servants, who hope in the multitude of Thy mercies, vouchsafe to grant some part and fellowship with Thy holy Apostles and Martyrs, with John, Stephen, Matthias, Barnabas, Ignatius, Alexander, Marcellinus, Peter, Felicitas, Perpetua, Agatha,
Lucy, Agnes, Cecilia, Anastasia, and all Thy Saints, into whose company, not weighing our merits but pardoning our offences, we beseech Thee to admit us. Through Christ our Lord, by Whom, O Lord, Thou ever createst,
<? $sm->mcross(); ?>sanctifiest,
<? $sm->mcross(); ?>quickenest,
<? $sm->mcross(); ?>blessest and bestowest upon us all these good things.
</p>

<? $sm->insparg("The host and the chalice are held up."); ?>

<p>
By Him and with Him and in Him is unto Thee God the Father
Almighty, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory.
</p>

<p><u>Amen.</u></p>
